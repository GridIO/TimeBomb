# Timebomb

**Scenario by:** [Tman1829765](https://reddit.com/u/Tman1829765)

**Description:**

After killing a player all of their items will appear in a double chest rather than dropping on the ground. You then have a set time amount of seconds to loot what you want and get the hell away from it. This is because the chest explodes after the time is up.

___

**Make sure to have the head drop as an item for it to be added to the chest if you have heads on for this**

**Head posts also work**
